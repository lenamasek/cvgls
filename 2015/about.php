          <p class="about-paragraph">The law is always a step behind technology. In particular, the legal profession has expressed extreme difficulty in addressing the technical and expressive qualities present in video games. Video games are subtly complex by their very nature, and do not seem to fit completely into any singular field of law. The fields of copyright, trademark, patent, constitutional, and business law have all been applied to video games in an effort to regulate and protect them. As often as not, as many conflicting applications of law emerge as congruent ones.</p>

          <p class="about-paragraph">The John Marshall Video Game Law Society was founded in May of 2014. Through its membership and events like the Chicago Video Game Law Summit, the VGLS has two goals: to inform the legal community of the unique legal protections video games require, and reach out to the game industry to raise awareness of what legal protections are available for the medium. The Chicago Video Game Law Summit is the first annual symposium hosted by the VGLS, and aims to create a public forum where gamers and lawyers can explore, explain, and debate the latest issues in video game law.</p>
